godep - dependency tool for go

Usage: godep command [arguments]

Commands:

	save	save current list of dependencies
	go	run go tool with previously saved dependencies

Writes and reads file Godeps in the current directory.

Godeps format:

- processed line-by-line
- characters from # to end of line are discarded
- blank lines are discarded
- first line names the package that owns the deps
- second line has output of `go version`
- subsequent lines list needed packages with versions
- packages in the standard library are omitted
- packages inside another listed package are omitted
- each dep line has two tab-separated fields:
  - commit hash
  - package name

Example Godeps:

github.com/kr/hk
go version go1.0.3
28676070ab99	code.google.com/p/go-netrc/netrc
3380ade90f8b	github.com/kr/binarydist

Example commands:

$ godep save

$ godep go test
PASS
ok  	github.com/kr/hk	0.021s

$ godep go build

$ godep go run x.go

$ godep go install -tags heroku ./...
# note: copies binaries to outer $GOPATH/bin

$ godep go test
godep: missing dependency: go version go1.0.3
godep: have: go version go1.1
